This tutorial demonstrates how to create and train a [sequence-to-sequence](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#sequence-to-sequence-task) [Transformer](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#Transformer) model to translate [Portuguese into English](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ted_hrlr_translate#ted_hrlr_translatept_to_en). The Transformer was originally proposed in ["Attention is all you need"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) by Vaswani et al. (2017).

Transformers are deep neural networks that replace CNNs and RNNs with [self-attention](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#self-attention). Self attention allows Transformers to easily transmit information across the input sequences.

As explained in the [Google AI Blog post](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html):

> Neural networks for machine translation typically contain an encoder reading the input sentence and generating a representation of it. A decoder then generates the output sentence word by word while consulting the representation generated by the encoder. The Transformer starts by generating initial representations, or embeddings, for each word... Then, using self-attention, it aggregates information from all of the other words, generating a new representation per word informed by the entire context, represented by the filled balls. This step is then repeated multiple times in parallel for all words, successively generating new representations.

Figure 1: Applying the Transformer to machine translation. Source: [Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/transformer-novel-neural-network.html).

That's a lot to digest, the goal of this tutorial is to break it down into easy to understand parts. In this tutorial you will:

- Prepare the data.
- Implement necessary components:
  - Positional embeddings.
  - Attention layers.
  - The encoder and decoder.
- Build & train the Transformer.
- Generate translations.
- Export the model.

To get the most out of this tutorial, it helps if you know about [the basics of text generation](./text_generation.ipynb) and attention mechanisms.

A Transformer is a sequence-to-sequence encoder-decoder model similar to the model in the [NMT with attention tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention).
A single-layer Transformer takes a little more code to write, but is almost identical to that encoder-decoder RNN model. The only difference is that the RNN layers are replaced with self attention layers.
This tutorial builds a 4-layer Transformer which is larger and more powerful, but not fundamentally more complex.

## Why Transformers are significant

- Transformers excel at modeling sequential data, such as natural language.
- Unlike the [recurrent neural networks (RNNs)](./text_generation.ipynb), Transformers are parallelizable. This makes them efficient on hardware like GPUs and TPUs. The main reasons is that Transformers replaced recurrence with attention, and computations can happen simultaneously. Layer outputs can be computed in parallel, instead of a series like an RNN.
- Unlike [RNNs](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/rnn) (like [seq2seq, 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215)) or [convolutional neural networks (CNNs)](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/images/cnn) (for example, [ByteNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.10099)), Transformers are able to capture distant or long-range contexts and dependencies in the data between distant positions in the input or output sequences. Thus, longer connections can be learned. Attention allows each location to have access to the entire input at each layer, while in RNNs and CNNs, the information needs to pass through many processing steps to move a long distance, which makes it harder to learn.
- Transformers make no assumptions about the temporal/spatial relationships across the data. This is ideal for processing a set of objects (for example, [StarCraft units](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii)).

## Setup

Begin by installing [TensorFlow Datasets](https://tensorflow.org/datasets) for loading the dataset and [TensorFlow Text](https://www.tensorflow.org/text) for text preprocessing:
"""

# Install the most re version of TensorFlow to use the improved
# masking support for `tf.keras.layers.MultiHeadAttention`.
# !apt install --allow-change-held-packages libcudnn8=8.1.0.77-1+cuda11.2
# !pip uninstall -y -q tensorflow keras tensorflow-estimator tensorflow-text
# !pip install protobuf~=3.20.3
# !pip install -q tensorflow_datasets
# !pip install -q -U tensorflow-text tensorflow

"""Import the necessary modules:"""

import logging
import time

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

import tensorflow_datasets as tfds
import tensorflow as tf

# import tensorflow_text ???

"""## Data handling

This section downloads the dataset and the subword tokenizer, from [this tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/subwords_tokenizer), then wraps it all up in a `tf.data.Dataset` for training.

 <button type="button" class="button-red button expand-control">Toggle section</button>

### Download the dataset

Use TensorFlow Datasets to load the [Portuguese-English translation dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/ted_hrlr_translate#ted_hrlr_translatept_to_en)D Talks Open Translation Project. This dataset contains approximately 52,000 training, 1,200 validation and 1,800 test examples.

examples, metadata = tfds.load('ted_hrlr_translate/pt_to_en',
                               with_info=True,

  print('> Examples in English:')
  for en in en_examples.numpy():
    print(en.decode('utf-8'))

"""### Set up the tokenizer

Now that you have loaded the dataset, you need to tokenize the text, so that each element is represented as a [token](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#token) or token ID (a numeric representation).

Tokenization is the process of breaking up text, into "tokens". Depending on the tokenizer, these tokens can represent sentence-pieces, words, subwords, or characters. To learn more about tokenization, visit [this guide](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/tokenizers).

This tutorial uses the tokenizers built in the [subword tokenizer](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/guide/subwords_tokenizer) tutorial. That tutorial optimizes two `text.BertTokenizer` objects (one for English, one for Portuguese) for **this dataset** and exports them in a TensorFlow `saved_model` format.

> Note: This is different from the [original paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762.pdf), section 5.1, where they used a single byte-pair tokenizer for both the source and target with a vocabulary-size of 37000.

This is the same as the [text generation tutorial](text_generation.ipynb),
except here you have additional input "context" (the Portuguese sequence) that the model is "conditioned" on.

This setup is called "teacher forcing" because regardless of the model's output at each timestep, it gets the true value as input for the next timestep.
This is a simple and efficient way to train a text generation model.
It's efficient because you don't need to run the model sequentially, the outputs at the different sequence locations can be computed in parallel.

You might have expected the `input, output`, pairs to simply be the `Portuguese, English` sequences.
Given the Portuguese sequence, the model would try to generate the English sequence.

It's possible to train a model that way. You'd need to write out the inference loop and pass the model's output back to the input.
It's slower (time steps can't run in parallel), and a harder task to learn (the model can't get the end of a sentence right until it gets the beginning right),
but it can give a more stable model because the model has to learn to correct its own errors during training.

### The embedding and positional encoding layer

The inputs to both the encoder and decoder use the same embedding and positional encoding logic.

</table>

Given a sequence of tokens, both the input tokens (Portuguese) and target tokens (English) have to be converted to vectors using a `tf.keras.layers.Embedding` layer.

The attention layers used throughout the model see their input as a set of vectors, with no order. Since the model doesn't contain any recurrent or convolutional layers. It needs some way to identify word order, otherwise it would see the input sequence as a [bag of words](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary#bag-of-words) instance, `how are you`, `how you are`, `you how are`, and so on, are indistinguishable.

A Transformer adds a "Positional Encoding" to the embedding vectors. It uses a set of sines and cosines at different frequencies (across the sequence). By definition nearby elements will have similar position encodings.

The original paper uses the following formula for calculating the positional encoding:

$$\Large{PE_{(pos, 2i)} = \sin(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})} $$
$$\Large{PE_{(pos, 2i+1)} = \cos(pos / 10000^{2i / d_{model}})} $$

Note: The code below implements it, but instead of interleaving the sines and cosines, the vectors of sines and cosines are simply concatenated. Permuting the channels like this is functionally equivalent, and just a little easier to implement and show in the plots below.
"""

  depth = depth/2

These "Add & Norm" blocks are scattered throughout the model. Each one joins a residual connection and runs the result through a `LayerNormalization` layer.

The easiest way to organize the code is around these residual blocks. The following sections will define custom layer classes for each.

The residual "Add & Norm" blocks are included so that training is efficient. The residual connection provides a direct path for the gradient (and ensures that vectors are **updated** by the attention layers instead of **replaced**), while the normalization maintains a reasonable scale for the outputs.

Note: The implementations, below, use the `Add` layer to ensure that Keras masks are propagated (the `+` operator does not).

### The base attention layer

Attention layers are used throughout the model. These are all identical except for how the attention is configured. Each one contains a `layers.MultiHeadAttention`, a `layers.LayerNormalization` and a `layers.Add`.

Before you get into the specifics of each usage, here is a quick refresher on how attention works:

</table>

There are two inputs:

1. The query sequence; the sequence being processed; the sequence doing the attending (bottom).
2. The context sequence; the sequence being attended to (left).

The output has the same shape as the query-sequence.

The common comparison is that this operation is like a dictionary lookup.
A **fuzzy**, **differentiable**, **vectorized** dictionary lookup.

Here's a regular python dictionary, with 3 keys and 3 values being passed a single query.

```
d = {'color': 'blue', 'age': 22, 'type': 'pickup'}
result = d['color']
```

- The `query`s is what you're trying to find.
- The `key`s what sort of information the dictionary has.
- The `value` is that information.

When you look up a `query` in a regular dictionary, the dictionary finds the matching `key`, and returns its associated `value`.
The `query` either has a matching `key` or it doesn't.
You can imagine a **fuzzy** dictionary where the keys don't have to match perfectly.
If you looked up `d["species"]` in the dictionary above, maybe you'd want it to return `"pickup"` since that's the best match for the query.

An attention layer does a fuzzy lookup like this, but it's not just looking for the best key.
It combines the `values` based on how well the `query` matches each `key`.

How does that work? In an attention layer the `query`, `key`, and `value` are each vectors.
Instead of doing a hash lookup the attention layer combines the `query` and `key` vectors to determine how well they match, the "attention score".
The layer returns the average across all the `values`, weighted by the "attention scores".

Each location the query-sequence provides a `query` vector.
The context sequence acts as the dictionary. At each location in the context sequence provides a `key` and `value` vector.
The input vectors are not used directly, the `layers.MultiHeadAttention` layer includes `layers.Dense` layers to project the input vectors before using them.

### The cross attention layer

At the literal center of the Transformer is the cross-attention layer. This layer connects the encoder and decoder. This layer is the most straight-forward use of attention in the model, it performs the same task as the attention block in the [NMT with attention tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention).

<tr>

   <img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/CrossAttention.png"/>
  </td>

To implement this you pass the target sequence `x` as the `query` and the `context` sequence as the `key/value` when calling the `mha` layer:
"""

class CrossAttention(BaseAttention):
  def call(self, x, context):
    attn_output, attn_scores = self.mha(

The diagram is further simplified, below. There's no need to draw the entire "Attention weights" matrix.
The point is that each `query` location can see all the `key/value` pairs in the context, but no information is exchanged between the queries.

"""### The global self attention layer

This layer is responsible for processing the context sequence, and propagating information along its length:

<tr>
<tr>
  <td>
   <img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/SelfAttention.png"/>
  </td>

</table>

Since the context sequence is fixed while the translation is being generated, information is allowed to flow in both directions.

Before Transformers and self attention, models commonly used RNNs or CNNs to do this task:

<table>
<tr>
  <th colspan=1>Bidirectional RNNs and CNNs</th>

  <td>
   <img width=500 src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/RNN-bidirectional.png"/>

<tr>

  </td>
</tr>
</table>

RNNs and CNNs have their limitations.

- The RNN allows information to flow all the way across the sequence, but it passes through many processing steps to get there (limiting gradient flow). These RNN steps have to be run sequentially and so the RNN is less able to take advantage of modern parallel devices.
- In the CNN each location can be processed in parallel, but it only provides a limited receptive field. The receptive field only grows linearly with the number of CNN layers,  You need to stack a number of Convolution layers to transmit information across the sequence ([Wavenet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.03499) reduces this problem by using dilated convolutions).

The global self attention layer on the other hand lets every sequence element directly access every other sequence element, with only a few operations, and all the outputs can be computed in parallel.

To implement this layer you just need to pass the target sequence, `x`, as both the `query`, and `value` arguments to the `mha` layer:
"""

class GlobalSelfAttention(BaseAttention):
  def call(self, x):
    attn_output = self.mha(
        query=x,
        value=x,
        key=x)
    x = self.add([x, attn_output])
    x = self.layernorm(x)
    return x

sample_gsa = GlobalSelfAttention(num_heads=2, key_dim=512)

print(pt_emb.shape)
print(sample_gsa(pt_emb).shape)

"""Sticking with the same style as before you could draw it like this:

  <td>
   <img width=330 src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/SelfAttention-new-full.png"/>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

Again, the residual connections are omitted for clarity.

It's more compact, and just as accurate to draw it like this:

### The causal self attention layer

This layer does a similar job as the global self attention layer, for the output sequence:

   <img src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/CausalSelfAttention.png"/>

This needs to be handled differently from the encoder's global self attention layer.  

Like the [text generation tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/text_generation), and the [NMT with attention](https://www.tensorflow.org/text/tutorials/nmt_with_attention) tutorial, Transformers are an "autoregressive" model: They generate the text one token at a time and feed that output back to the input. To make this _efficient_, these models ensure that the output for each sequence element only depends on the previous sequence elements; the models are "causal".

A single-direction RNN is causal by definition. To make a causal convolution you just need to pad the input and shift the output so that it aligns correctly (use `layers.Conv1D(padding='causal')`) .

<table>
<tr>
  <th colspan=1>Causal RNNs and CNNs</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
   <img width=500 src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/RNN.png"/>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>
   <img width=500 src="https://www.tensorflow.org/images/tutorials/transformer/CNN-causal.png"/>
  </td>
</tr>
</table>

A causal model is efficient in two ways:

1. In training, it lets you compute loss for every location in the output sequence while executing the model just once.
2. During inference, for each new token generated you only need to calculate its outputs, the outputs for the previous sequence elements can be reused.
  - For an RNN you just need the RNN-state to account for previous computations (pass `return_state=True` to the RNN layer's constructor).
  - For a CNN you would need to follow the approach of [Fast Wavenet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.09482)

To build a causal self attention layer, you need to use an appropriate mask when computing the attention scores and summing the attention `value`s.

This is taken care of automatically if you pass `use_causal_mask = True` to the `MultiHeadAttention` layer when you call it:
"""

class CausalSelfAttention(BaseAttention):
  def call(self, x):
    attn_output = self.mha(
        query=x,
        value=x,
        key=x,
        use_causal_mask = True)
    x = self.add([x, attn_output])
    x = self.layernorm(x)
    return x

"""The causal mask ensures that each location only has access to the locations that come before it:

"""## Run inference

You can now test the model by performing a translation. The following steps are used for inference:

* Encode the input sentence using the Portuguese tokenizer (`tokenizers.pt`). This is the encoder input.
* The decoder input is initialized to the `[START]` token.
* Calculate the padding masks and the look ahead masks.
* The `decoder` then outputs the predictions by looking at the `encoder output` and its own output (self-attention).
* Concatenate the predicted token to the decoder input and pass it to the decoder.
* In this approach, the decoder predicts the next token based on the previous tokens it predicted.

Note: The model is optimized for _efficient training_ and makes a next-token prediction for each token in the output simultaneously. This is redundant during inference, and only the last prediction is used.  This model can be made more efficient for inference if you only calculate the last prediction when running in inference mode (`training=False`).

"""## Conclusion

In this tutorial you learned about:

* The Transformers and their significance in machine learning
* Attention, self-attention and multi-head attention
* Positional encoding with embeddings
* The encoder-decoder architecture of the original Transformer
* Masking in self-attention
* How to put it all together to translate text

The downsides of this architecture are:

- For a time-series, the output for a time-step is calculated from the *entire history* instead of only the inputs and current hidden-state. This _may_ be less efficient.
- If the input has a temporal/spatial relationship, like text or images, some positional encoding must be added or the model will effectively see a bag of words.

If you want to practice, there are many things you could try with it. For example:

* Use a different dataset to train the Transformer.
* Create the "Base Transformer" or "Transformer XL" configurations from the original paper by changing the hyperparameters.
* Use the layers defined here to create an implementation of [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)
* Use Beam search to get better predictions.

There are a wide variety of Transformer-based models, many of which improve upon the 2017 version of the original Transformer with encoder-decoder, encoder-only and decoder-only architectures.

Some of these models are covered in the following research publications:

* ["Efficient Transformers: a survey"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.06732) (Tay et al., 2022)
* ["Formal algorithms for Transformers"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09238) (Phuong and Hutter, 2022).
* [T5 ("Exploring the limits of transfer learning with a unified text-to-text Transformer")](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.10683) (Raffel et al., 2019)
